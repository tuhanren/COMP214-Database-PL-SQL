### Introduction

The old model of a single computer serving all of the organizationâ€™s computational needs has been replaced by one in which a large number of separate but interconnected computers do the job. These systems are called **computer networks**.

The key distinction is that in a **distributed system**, a collection of independent computers appears to its users as a single coherent system.

A well-known example of a distributed system is the **World Wide Web**. It runs on top of the Internet and presents a model in which everything looks like a document (Web page).  

Networks called **VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)** may be used to join the individual networks at different sites into one extended network. In other words, the mere fact that a user happens to be 15,000 km away from his data should not prevent him from using the data as though they were local.  

This whole arrangement is called the **client-server model**. It is widely used and forms the basis of much network usage. The most popular realization is that of a Web application, in which the server generates Web pages based on its data-base in response to client requests that may update the database.

Much of this information is accessed using the client-server model, but there is different, popular model for accessing information that goes by the name of peer-to-peer communication (Parameswaran et al., 2001).
