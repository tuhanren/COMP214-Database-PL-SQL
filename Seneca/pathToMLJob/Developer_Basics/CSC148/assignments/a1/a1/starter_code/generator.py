===== Module Description =====

This module generates random parcel and truck data and writes each to a file.
Values defined in the module control the amount of data, the range of possible
values, etc.

You have no tasks associated with this module.  It is provided to you to assist
in testing.  However, your best test cases will likely be very small ones that
you hand-craft to force important conditions to arise.
