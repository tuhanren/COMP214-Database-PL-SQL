===== Module Description =====

This module contains class SchedulingExperiment.  It can create an experiment
with input data and an algorithm configuration specified in a dictionary, then
run the experiment, generate statistics as the result of the experiment, and
(optionally) report the statistics.

This module is responsible for all the reading of data from the data files.

class SchedulingExperiment:
    """An experiment in scheduling parcels for delivery.

    To complete an experiment involves four stages:

    1. Read in all data from necessary files, and create corresponding objects.
    2. Run a scheduling algorithm to assign parcels to trucks.
    3. Compute statistics showing how good the assignment of parcels to trucks
       is.
    4. Report the statistics from the experiment.

    === Public Attributes ===
    verbose:
      If <verbose> is True, print step-by-step details regarding the scheduling
      algorithm as it runs.
    scheduler:
      The scheduler to use in this experiment.
    parcels:
      The parcels to schedule in this experiment.
    fleet:
      The trucks that parcels are scheduled to in this experiment.
    dmap:
      The distances between cities in this experiment.

    === Private Attributes ===
    _stats:
      A dictionary of statistics. <_stats>'s value is undefined until
      <self>._compute_stats is called, at which point it contains keys and
      values as specified in Step 6 of Assignment 1.
    _unscheduled:
      A list of parcels. <_unscheduled>'s value is undefined until <self>.run
      is called, at which point it contains the list of parcels that could
      not be scheduled in the experiment.

    === Representation Invariants ===
    - <fleet> contains at least one truck
    - <dmap> contains all of the distances required to compute the length of
      any possible route for the trucks in <fleet> delivering the packages in
      <parcels>.
