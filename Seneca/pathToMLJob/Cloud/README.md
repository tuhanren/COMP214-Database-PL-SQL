# Cloud Computing  

New way to deliver compute services, more cost efficient and agile. **Elastic Scaling**.  
From NIST (National Institute for Standards in Technology), cloud computing have characteristics:
    - On-demand self-service
    - Ubiquitous network access
    - Resource pooling
    - Rapid elasticity
    - pay per use
There are three delivery models: SaaS (software as a service), Paas (platform as a service) and Iaas (Infrastructure as a service).  
Three deployment models: private, public and hybrid.  

## Deployment

### Private

More secure.  
You own the hardware the the cloud runs on.  

### Public

Leveraging the cloud services over the open internet. Don't need to purchase hardware.  

### Hybrid

The combination of private and public cloud. Sometimes, workloads can move between private and public.

## Three Major Types

### SaaS

Rent finished application over the open internet. Application delivered through web browser.  
Salesforce.com is the largest SaaS provider, CRM (customer relationship management) and ERP (enterprise resource planning). Google Apps for Work. Microsoft 365.  

### IaaS

Storage, computer and other infrastructure services you leverage from some local or remote resource. This is to replace data center.  
Including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP).  
It can be private, public and hybrid.  
Example, AWS EC2 instance.

### PaaS

An application development, testing and **deployment** platform. Such as Google App Engine, AWS's Elastic Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure.  
A trend of combine PaaS and IaaS.  

## Planning  

### TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)

Pure TCO + Transitional Costs

### ROI (Return on Investment)  

Finally, full program costs vs. value calculations.

#### Key Points

- Agility  
  1. Rapid elasticity
  2. Capacity always available
  3. Rapid disaster recovery
  4. Seamless support for different endpoints
- Cost of retired hardware  
- Changes to maintain service level
- Software cost on cloud
- Organization transform cost
